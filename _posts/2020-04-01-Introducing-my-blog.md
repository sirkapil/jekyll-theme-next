I hope you guys will be fine and staying back at home in this lockdown period.

Guys, I'm feeling really excited to introduce my first ever blog. Actually, blogging has been one of my favourite spare time hobby. So, it was worth of giving it a try. To have an online space where i can write about the things that i like; for the things, i feel much comfortable.

Let me first clear up a few things!

## What is this blog all about?

Well, I planned that my first blog should be all about my passion, Maths. So, Here i'll be posting random questions and their solutions. It may involve some interesting facts and experiences that i feel are worth sharing for. So, you can expect this blog to be only related to mathematics.


## Reason for this blog


* Online Cataloguing
   
    (The actual reason to have this blog was that i needed a proper online catalogue of my notes and answers that i post on Chegg Inc.)

* Sharing is Caring 
  
    (Everything will be free here, Unlike Chegg where you need a subscription to see this catalogue)

* Passion for this subject
    
    (Infact, it should be the main reason)

* I'm bored at home. üòÇ

    (koi lockdown hatwao yrr. Translation: Anyone please uplift this lockdown.)

## Will you post consistently?

I'm planning to post consistently on this blog. I will try to post as much as i can. But, you can expect daily around four or five post as of now. (Mostly those questions which i feel are worth sharing for, Not all the stuff that i do for Chegg Inc.)

## Final Words:

Well guys, This is my first blog. I have just started so i would like to have a few favours from you.
