title: find the coeffiecients of linear combination analytically.

description: 
  let ${ v_1 , v_2 , v_3}$ be an orthogonal set in $R^3$ , let $w$ be any given vector in $R^3$ which is wrriten as linear combination of vectors ${ v_1 , v_2 , v_3}$. find coeffiecientsanalytically (without matrix method)
